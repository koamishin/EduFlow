    | Payment Submission Runtime
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | Durable submission work is recorded the moment a payment is authorized,
    | but nothing is ever handed to a worker unless an operator turns this on.
    | Enabling it is a separate, reviewed decision because it is the first step
    | toward an executor that talks to a rail, and the release it points at.
    |
    | The isolated executor ships in this build but is gated behind this flag,
    | and behind an explicit Arc *testnet* rail check with no fallback. A
    | dispatched entry with the runtime off is inspected and concluded as
    | blocked with a specific reason; it is never submitted.
    |
    | `stop_switch` holds new submissions without erasing evidence or
    | releasing a hold.
    |
    | `transport` selects how the rail answers. `auto` treats a Circle driver as
    | an asynchronous agent wallet, which is what it is: `circle wallet
    | transfer` returns a Circle transaction id rather than an on-chain hash, so
    | a synchronous submission would fail on every single payment. Setting
    | `synchronous` forces the older contract, which is correct only for a rail
    | that genuinely returns a hash from `transfer()`.
