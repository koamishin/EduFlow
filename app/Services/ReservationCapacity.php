/**
 * Two different totals over the same holds, and confusing them would corrupt
 * either the audit trail or the capacity arithmetic.
 *
 * - `chainTotal` is the **historical** cumulative sum in reservation id order.
 *   It is what each hold recorded as `prior_reserved_base_units`, and it must
 *   reproduce exactly, forever. It never decreases, because a released hold
 *   still happened.
 * - `consumingTotal` is what capacity is actually unavailable right now: the
 *   chain total less the exact totals of independently approved releases.
 *
 * A release therefore does not rewrite the chain. It adds a fact, and the
 * admission check for a new hold reads `consumingTotal`. Anyone auditing can
 * still see the hold, its position, who took it and who released it.
