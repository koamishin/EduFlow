/**
 * Ask a cheap classification model which bills might deserve a standing
 * mandate, and return only what survives as advice.
 *
 * This is Jev -- a "System One" model reached through the Laravel AI SDK's
 * classification capability, which answers in milliseconds for a small fraction
 * of a text model's cost. Routing a ticket or picking a branch is exactly that
 * shape of problem, and it is the only shape of problem this system will ever
 * put in front of a model on the payment path.
 *
 * Three boundaries are deliberate and structural rather than conventional:
 *
 *  - **It ranks, it never authorises.** The output type has no amount, no
 *    recipient and no verdict in it, so there is nothing here a caller could
 *    promote into a payment even by mistake.
 *  - **It never sees the decision inputs.** The deterministic evaluator is a
 *    pure function of evidence; nothing this class returns is fed to it. A
 *    supervisor may use this to decide *which mandate to sign*, never whether
 *    a particular occurrence may pay.
 *  - **It fails closed.** No key, an unreachable endpoint, a timeout or a
 *    malformed answer all return null. A missing model costs a supervisor a
 *    little reading time; a model that failed *open* could quietly widen what
 *    pays without a human.
