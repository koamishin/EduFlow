/**
 * Counts for the autonomous lane, kept deliberately separate.
 *
 * §14.6 and §18.6 require that these never be collapsed into one flattering
 * number, so this service reports them as distinct measures with distinct
 * names:
 *
 * - **decisions vs escalated** — what the deterministic evaluator concluded for
 *   each obligation it looked at. `release` means every gate passed; `escalate`
 *   means valid but outside the mandate; `blocked` means it could not be
 *   released at all. Counting these together as "handled" would hide a lane that
 *   escalates everything and is therefore autonomous in name only.
 * - **retrospective agreement** — a *sample* of automatically released
 *   occurrences shown to the responsible supervisor afterwards, who records
 *   whether they would have decided the same thing.
 *
 * The second is **feedback, not approval**, and there is no per-item approval
 * for an automatic release because there is no per-item approver. It is
 * reported under its own name and must never be presented as an authorization
 * metric, a correctness measure, or evidence that a payment was right.
 *
 * Note also what is deliberately absent: there is no "approval-as-is rate" for
 * this lane. That metric is defined over proposals a human actually reviewed,
 * and automatic releases by definition had none, so computing one here would
 * invent a denominator.
