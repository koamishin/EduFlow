/**
 * Records a supervisor's later view on an automatically released occurrence.
 *
 * This is the honest answer to "how often did the admin agree with the
 * system?", and the honesty is the point. §18.6 is explicit that it is
 * **retrospective feedback, not per-item approval and not proof of
 * correctness**, so:
 *
 * - it may only be recorded against an occurrence that was actually released;
 * - it is one value per occurrence, so repeated reviews cannot inflate a rate;
 * - it approves nothing, and `isApproval()` returns false by design.
 *
 * There is deliberately no "approval-as-is rate" for this lane. That metric is
 * defined over proposals a human reviewed and resolved, and an automatic
 * release had no such proposal; computing one here would invent a denominator.
