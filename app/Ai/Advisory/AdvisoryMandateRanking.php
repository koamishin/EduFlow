/**
 * A model's read on which bills might deserve a standing mandate.
 *
 * This is a reading, not a decision, and the type is shaped so it cannot become
 * one. It carries no amount of authority to spend, no recipient, no ceiling and
 * no verdict -- only a likelihood that a bill repeats, whether its amount looks
 * stable, and a short reason a human can argue with.
 *
 * The distinction matters more here than anywhere else in the product. A
 * standing mandate is the only construct that lets a payment happen with no
 * human present, so the question "should this bill pay itself?" is answered by a
 * reviewer who signs a mandate, and then by deterministic PHP on each
 * occurrence. A model's opinion can make that review faster. It cannot replace
 * it, and nothing here is shaped so that it could be mistaken for doing so.
