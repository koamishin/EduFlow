/**
 * The only path from a human decision to a resumed tool call.
 *
 * Six checks stand between a reviewer clicking approve and money moving, and
 * each exists because the obvious implementation is wrong in a specific way:
 *
 *  1. **Authorisation.** Only a role that may approve assistance may resume.
 *     Verified through the Gate, not by reading a role name here, so the panel
 *     and this endpoint cannot drift apart.
 *  2. **Conversation ownership.** `RemembersConversations::continue()` trusts any
 *     conversation id it is given. Without `conversationBelongsTo()`, any
 *     authenticated reviewer could resume another officer's paused run, and
 *     approving it would release that officer's disbursement.
 *  3. **Pending set.** Submitted ids must be a subset of what is genuinely
 *     paused in that conversation, so a stale or foreign id is refused instead
 *     of passed through to the SDK.
 *  4. **Tool allowlist.** Only `DisburseAssistance` may be approved, and its
 *     arguments are not editable. Authorising the proposal the model actually
 *     made is a different act from rewriting it.
 *  5. **Provenance of the target.** The assistance request id is read from the
 *     *stored* pending approval, never from the submitted payload, so a caller
 *     cannot point an approval at a different student.
 *  6. **The settings gate.** With settlement proposals off there is nothing
 *     legitimate to approve, so the resume is refused.
 *
 * A hash returned here is a claim, never proof. `settlements` reports what the
 * ledger recorded, and `requires_onchain_verification` stays true until
 * `lepton:reconcile` proves it on-chain.
