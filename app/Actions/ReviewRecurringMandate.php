/**
 * The only thing that can turn a proposed mandate into an authorized one.
 *
 * §14.7 is explicit: no agent or policy maker may self-authorize a mandate. So
 * the reviewer must be a human other than the preparer, and a service account is
 * not a human — admitting one here would be the whole failure the constraint
 * exists to prevent. Exactly one terminal decision is allowed per mandate, and
 * it is append-only, so "authorized" cannot drift after the fact.
 *
 * Approving authorizes a **class** of payment. It authorizes no payment: a
 * released occurrence still needs its own funding window, reservation and outbox
 * entry, and if the approved ceiling is zero it releases nothing at all.
