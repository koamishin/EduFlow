/**
 * Reviewed funding-window rollover.
 *
 * A window lives 15 minutes and is immutable, so an unattended lane needs a
 * way to renew it. The invariant under test throughout is that renewal renews
 * the *clock*, never the money: a successor to a window that already holds
 * capacity must not make that capacity available again.
 *
 * The reason this is subtle is that capacity is cumulative and institution-wide.
 * Verifying each historical hold against whatever window happens to be current
 * would make a re-observed balance corrupt holds that were validly taken, so
 * `ReservationCapacity` is checked against each hold's own window and admission
 * for a new hold is checked separately against the current one.
